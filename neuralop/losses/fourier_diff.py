    """
    Compute the 1D Fourier derivative of a given tensor.
    Use with care, as Fourier continuation and Fourier derivatives are not always stable.
    
    FC derivatives are more stable when the original signal is nearly periodic 
        (i.e., values and slopes at boundaries match or are close).
        and when the signal is smooth and has no sharp jumps/discontinuities at the boundaries.
    
    Use Fourier continuation to extend the signal if it is non-periodic. 
    
    Unstable behavior can occur if the signal has strong discontinuities or non-matching derivatives at boundaries,
        and if the continuation introduces artificial oscillations (Gibbs phenomenon).

    Signs of instability include boundary artifacts, high-frequency ringing, or growing errors with higher resolution.
    
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    u : torch.Tensor
        Input tensor. The derivative will be computed along the last dimension.
    order : int, optional
        Order of the derivative, by default 1
    L : float, optional
        Length of the domain considered, by default 2*pi
    use_FC : str, optional
        Whether to use Fourier continuation. Use for non-periodic functions.
        Options: None, 'Legendre', 'Gram', by default False
    FC_d : int, optional
        'Degree' of the Fourier continuation, by default 4
    FC_n_additional_pts : int, optional
        Number of points to add using the Fourier continuation layer, by default 50
        For FC-Gram continuation, it is usually not necessary to change this parameter. 
        This has a bigger effect on FC-Legendre continuation.
    low_pass_filter_ratio : float, optional
        If not None, apply a low-pass filter to the Fourier coefficients. 
        Can help reduce artificial oscillations. 1.0 means no filtering, 
        0.5 means keep half of the coefficients, etc., by default None

    Returns
    -------
    torch.Tensor
        The derivative of the input tensor.
        
    Notes
    -----
    When using Fourier continuation, the function automatically adjusts the 
    domain length L to account for the extended signal. The result is cropped 
    back to the original interval size.
    
    Warnings
    --------
    Consider using Fourier continuation if the input is not periodic (use_FC=True).
    Fourier continuation and Fourier derivatives can be numerically unstable
    for certain functions and parameter combinations.
